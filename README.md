## Requirements
Create a login application.
The UI can be any programming language and the backend must be using Java.
Upon successful login, there should be a welcome page that shows the name, username and role
(manager/user).
If the user has a manager role, the welcome page will have a link to access a restricted webpage.
This restricted webpage can only be accessed by a manager role and not by other user roles.
Do also implement logout functionality.
Notes:
- If the userid or password is not valid, I should remain at the login page with an error message
- Invalid userid or password.
- All data should be stored in a database.
- The application should demonstrate MVC pattern.

Bonus Question:
 The application should be able to support at least 2 languages (e.g. English, Mandarin).
